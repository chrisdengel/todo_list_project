# to-do-project
This is a simple to-do list that will save list items locally when browser is closed.

 I did this project from a turorial to get more familiar with CSS and Javascript. My goal over the next couple weeks are to add some features to this project that include:
 - Add Event Listener to the "Add" button that recognizes whe the ENTER button is clicked and adds the item
 - Make text input box wider and have the ability to overflow to the next line, as space is limited            (COMPLETED BY ADDING overflow-wrap: break-word)
 - Have multiple to-do lists(boards) on same page(similar to Trello) to keep track of multiple projects.
 - Find where local storage is held on my computer and see if I can learn how to make a GUI or something on the backend, folder, or spreadsheet.
